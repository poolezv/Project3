Using the cryptanalysis process and functions covered in Chapter 8 to do the following:

1. Implement a function called sortWords(listOfWords, len), which returns the list of words of the 
same length specified by len in listOfWords and has them sorted in descending order of frequencies. e.g.:
>>>sortWords(words, 3)
[('the', 4563), ('and', 2383), ('was', 832), ('had', 557), ...]
Store your function in a file called sortWords.py and upload it to Moodle.
Properly comment your function and use it in the cryptanalysis task below. 1%
2. Decode the attached cipher text using the process and functions covered in Chapter 8.
Clearly document your steps along with your code snippets so that I can verify your process. 3%
